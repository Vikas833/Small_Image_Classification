Overview

Small image classification is a common task in computer vision, where the goal is to classify images with smaller dimensions, often requiring efficient models to achieve high accuracy. This project aims to:
•	Build a robust pipeline for image classification.
•	Explore preprocessing techniques for small images.
•	Train and evaluate models using real-world datasets.

Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:
1.	Clone the Repository:
2.	git clone https://github.com/Vikas833/Small_Image_Classification.git
cd Small_Image_Classification
3.	Create a Virtual Environment (Optional):
4.	python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
5.	Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
6.	Download the Dataset: Add your dataset to the data/ directory (ensure proper structure as required by the script).
7.	Run the Script:
python train.py
________________________________________
Usage

1.	Place your dataset in the correct format inside the data/ folder.
2.	Run the preprocessing script to prepare your data:
python preprocess.py
3.	Train the model using:
python train.py
4.	Evaluate the model:
python evaluate.py

Dataset

The project supports custom datasets of small images. Ensure your dataset follows this structure:
data/
    train/
        class_1/
        class_2/
    test/
        class_1/
        class_2/
You can use popular datasets like CIFAR-10 or custom datasets for your experiments.
